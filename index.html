              The web is a collection of HTML documents connected by hyperlinks. There are about 30 billion pages. Browser requests via the internet to servers use HTTP. Servers respond with files that the browser displays, and servers host the files.

                  You need to add certain tags (!DOCTYPE html and html) to tell browser how to interpret code. You add head tag and then either put in style that will apply to the full document or put the link to the file of style code. In this file, you'll define class titles with the style that you want. You can also add style in the HTML file by using the style tag, but this leads to redundancies if it is done inline.

                      CSS stands for <u>Cascading Style Sheets</u> and the "cascading" part means that the most specific rule is applied to an element. <b>Inheritance</b> is the idea that properties are applied to the descendants of an element; properties like color, font, etc. are inherited from ancestor elements. <b>This makes it so you don't have to re-declare properties, eliminating redundancies</b>. Using inheritance to apply styles to multiple elements without having to rewrite them allows developers to write less CSS, which speeds up loading of web pages and saves money on development costs.

                        <b>Selectors</b> define the elements that styles will apply to. Style rules will apply to all tags that you define; you can use established element types (like h1 or p) to define all of those types of elements or use <b>class selectors</b> to name elements to style them differently based on class names. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS reference list</a> is very helpful in listing and explaining the CSS attributes.

You can calculate the size of an element by adding together the pixels of all of these components. If you set the size as a percentage, the element will adjust depending on the screen size. You can also position elements by using { display: flex; }, which will allow divs to appear next to each other.

You can test the validity of your <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS</a> and <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML</a> codes to make sure that it will work for all browsers.

            Precise use of spacing and grammar are important in Python. The Backus-Naur form is used for expressions, which uses <i>derivation</i> to replace non-terminals with other non-terminals, a combination of non-terminals, and finally terminals. Arithmetic grammar, for example, uses Expression-Operator-Expression format; as a <i>recursive definition</i>, it needs terminal and non-terminal rules to allow derivation. Also, Python will put an answer in integers if all numbers in the expression are integers.

In this way, you can use the same variable in the assignment statement because <i>the right side of the assignment statement is evaluated first</i>. <br>Example: if days=48, then output of days=days-1 is 47. <b><br><br>"=" does not mean the statement is an equality; it means the assignment of the right side's value to the variable on the left.</b>

            Indexing strings is extracting sub-sequences from a string. All extractions use square brackets, and the first character in a string starts at 0. Using negative numbers counts from the end of the string. You can do <b>one character extraction</b> or <b>subsequence extraction</b>. In subsequence extraction, you can select a range or everything up to or after a position. In one character extraction, if there is no character in a certain position, you'll get an error. In contrast, if there are no characters in a subsequence range, you'll get a blank output.

              <b>Mutation</b> is the ability to change the original value of something by replacing it, and lists support mutation. Strings and numbers are not mutable; they create a new string and disassociate with the original. This makes it important to pay attention if multiple variables reference an object that you change. <b>Aliasing</b> references referring to one object in different ways. Again, if you change the object, it affects everything that references it. You can also <u>append</u> [list.append(element)], which is adding element to end of list and is mutation. You can concatenate lists with "+" and this produces a new list via assignment, not mutation. <u>Length</u> [len(list)] coubts the number of elements (outer elements only; not components of list-within-list) in a list or number of characters in a string.

              <b>For loops</b> are a simpler way to do while loops for lists. "For name in list:" applies the block expression to each element (which is assigned the new name) until the end of the list. <b>Indexing</b> returns the first place in a list where the value occurs: list.index(value). It will return an error if the value isn't in the list. You can check if the value is in the list (T/F) with "print value in list".

              Object oriented programming is a different way of structuring programming that is focused on objects (instead of the logic used to create them).

              <u>Classes</u> are incredibly important. They allow you to apply a template of code to create multiple instances or objects. This is incredibly valuable for large programming projects that have repeated and similar objects. Using object oriented programming lets you create a single template (the class) to create all of these instances, which saves a lot of time, effort, and money. Using classes also make code modular, or separates functionality into modules that can be used again in other locations. A class can be seen as a "blueprint" that allows you to create different <u>instances</u> with different specifications. There is an "init" function within the class that creates space and memory for a new instance of that class. The init function is written as "__init__" and the underscores indicate that it is a reserved function of Python. When you create a new object or instance, you use "self" as the argument of the function definition.

              Inheritance also allows you to further reuse code (by importing it from a previous class and adding to it or tweaking it for the purposes of your current class), which is a beneficial aspect of object-oriented programming and saves time and money for programmers. It also allows your code to more intuitively match how we think. It references previously defined classes and you can use methods and variables from there. If you have a method in the newest class that has the same name as a method in the previous class that you are referencing, the new method will override the old (<u>method overriding</u>). This is similar to CSS's cascading structure, which applies the most specific rule to an element but otherwise using inherited rules. Both allow you to make the most of previously written code while tweaking any minor differences.
